# Brainstory

Think out loud! ðŸ§ 

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo, navigate into it
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`
4. Create a `.env.development` file at the top level and populate it with this:

```bash
PUBLIC_API_URL=<Your API URL>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Look through the repository for all instances of the URL `brainstory.ai`. You will want to remove and/or replace those with your own URL (or, if you're hosting on your local machine, with localhost).

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
